The dissenters, who have been continually persecuted, are believed to number about 20,000,000, although the Holy Synod officially puts the number at about 2,000,000. They are officially divided into three groups according to the degree of their variance from orthodox beliefs and observances, as follows: I. “Most obnoxious.” the Judaizers; the Molokane, who refuse to recognize civil authority or to take oaths; the Dukhobortsy, or Dukhobors, who are communistic, marry without ceremony, and believe that Christ was human, but that his soul reappears at intervals in living men; the Khlysty, who countenance anthropolatory, are ascetics, practice continual self-flagellation, and reject marriage; the Skoptsy, who practice castration; and a section of the Bezpopovtsy, or priestless sect, which disbelieve in prayers for the Czar and in marriage. II. “Obnoxious:” the Bezpopovtsy, who pray for the Czar and recognize marriage. III. “Least obnoxious:” the Popovtsy, who dissent from the orthodox church in minor points only.",

The special theory of relativity or special relativity is based on the proposition that the speed of light is a constant no matter how observed, and is independent of the motion of the observer.  From this follows several principles, such as the increase of mass with velocity (which has been confirmed: see relativistic mass equation) and the impossibility of acceleration to a speed greater than that of light; the equivalence of mass and energy, expressed by the famous equation E = mc2\n            ; and time dilation, which is the apparent slowing of a clock in a system, as observed by an observer in a system moving relative to the clock.  The general theory of relativity is based on the proposition that there is no physical difference between gravitational force and the force produced by acceleration.  From this follow several results, of which the bending of light rays in a gravitational field and the equivalence of the inertial and gravitational masses have been verified.  The possible existence of black holesbelieved by many astronomers to have been adequately proven) is another consequence of the theory.",

Rev. Stat. secs. 5191, 5192), three fifths of which the banks not in a reserve city (which see) may keep deposited as balances in national banks that are in reserve cities (U. S. Rev.

The reserve is always reckoned as a liability, and is calculated on net premiums. It is theoretically the difference between the present value of the total insurance and the present value of the future premiums on the insurance. The reserve, being an amount for which another company could, theoretically, afford to take over the insurance, is sometimes called the reinsurance fund or the self-insurance fund. For the first year upon any policy the net premium is called the initial reserve, and the balance left at the end of the year including interest is the terminal reserve. For subsequent years the initial reserve is the net premium, if any, plus the terminal reserve of the previous year. The portion of the reserve to be absorbed from the initial reserve in any year in payment of losses is sometimes called the insurance reserve, and the terminal reserve is then called the investment reserve.",

        "definition": "A chemical substance (C17H14O4S, molecular weight 314.36) used in medicine as an analgesic to alleviate pain and inflammation; it is a synthetic compound, and is marketed by Merck & Co. under the trade name Vioxx, in tablets giving dosages of 12.5 or 25 milligrams.  It is classed as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug\n         NSAID).  Chemically, it is 4-[4-(methylsulfony)phenyl]-3-phenyl-2(5H) furanone.  Its chemical structure contains two phenyl rings and a furanone ring.  It is believed to act by inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis, through inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2); unlike aspirin, it does not inhibit cyclooxygenase-1.",

Numa added two months, Januarius at the beginning of the year, and Februarius at the end, making in all 355 days. He also ordered an intercalary month, Mercedinus, to be inserted every second year. Later the order of the months was changed so that January should come before February. Through abuse of power by the pontiffs to whose care it was committed, this calendar fell into confusion. It was replaced by the Julian calendar. In designating the days of the month, the Romans reckoned backward from three fixed points, the calends, the nones, and the ides. The calends were always the first day of the month. The ides fell on the 15th in March, May, July (Quintilis), and October, and on the 13th in other months. The nones came on the eighth day (the ninth, counting the ides) before the ides. Thus, Jan. 13 was called the ides of January, Jan. 12, the day before the ides, and Jan. 11, the third day before the ides (since the ides count as one), while Jan. 14 was the 19th day before the calends of February.",

In 1988 the church, with official approval, celebrated the 1000 year anniversary of the baptism of Russia.  After breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 the Russian Church began to regain some its old influence in Russian life, and the government turned over some of the confiscated churches back to church control.  The Russian Church was recognized anew as the official church of Russia, with special priveleges, by an act of the Russian Duma in 1997.  The Metropolitan of Moscow, as Patriarch of the church, is regarded as the first among equals in order of deference among bishops of the church.",
