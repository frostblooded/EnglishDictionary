Some MACHOs have been discovered in the halo of dark matter that surrounds our milky way.

It was discovered in 1907 by Otto Hahn as a decay product of thorium (produced by decay of thorium-232).  Mesothorium-1 (radium-228) in turn produces actinium-228 (mesothorium-2) as the first product of its radioactive decay, and the actinium-228 in turn decays quickly (half-life of 6 hours) to thorium-228 (which is also called radiothorium; the thorium-228 has a half-life of 1.91 years, shorter than that of the radium-228).  It was discovered and named before full recognition of the nature of isotopes of the elements, and was distinguished from other variants of radium by its half-life and mode of production and decay.  It was also cheaper to prepare than other short-lived radium isotopes, and was thus sold commercially, for use, e.g. in making watch dials readable in the dark by painting the hands and hour marks with a self-luminous paint containing the radioactive substance; it is therefore often referred to (e.g. in regulatory legislation) as though distinct from radium.  It was one of the isotopes believed responsible for radiation-induced diseases observed in industrial workers who painted radium on watch dials in the late 1950's and early 1960's.  The primary isotope of radium (radium-226) has a half-life of 1620 years, and these isotopes with shorter half-lives proved difficult to isolate and study for the purpose of finding the cause of such diseases.",

The molecular formula may be written to provide some indication of the actual structure of the molecule, in which case structural units may be written separately.  Thus, ethyl alcohol can also be written as CH3.CH2.OH or CH3-CH2-OH, in which the period or dash between functional groups indicates a single bond between the principle atoms of each group.  This formula shows that in ethyl alcohol, the carbon of a methyl group (CH3-) is attached to the carbon of a methylene group (-CH2-), which is attached to the oxygen of a hydroxyl group (-OH).  A structural formula is a graphical depiction of the relative positions of atoms in a molecule, and may be very complicated.",

The fundamental aim is to create self-motivation for education, and the leading features are freedom for physical activity (no stationary desks and chairs), informal and individual instruction, the very early development of reading and writing skills, and an extended sensory and motor training (with special emphasis on vision, touch, perception of movement, and their interconnections), mediated by a patented, standardized system of “didactic apparatus,” which is declared to be “auto-regulative.”  Most of the chief features of the method are borrowed from current methods used in many institutions for training feeble-minded children, and dating back especially to the work of the French-American physician Edouard O. Seguin1812-80).",
