V and U are only varieties of the same character, U being the cursive form, while V is better adapted for engraving, as in stone. The two letters were formerly used indiscriminately, and till a comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see U). The letter V is from the Latin alphabet, where it was used both as a consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel Υ (see Y), this Greek letter being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma Fsee F), or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they took from the Semitic. Etymologically v is most nearly related to u\n            w\n            f\n            b\n            p; as in vine, wine; avoirdupois, habit, have; safe, save; trover, troubadour, trope.

The manifestations of disease caused by multiplication of viruses in cells may be due to destruction of the cells caused by subversion of the cellular metabolic processes by the virus, or by synthesis of a virus-specific toxin.
