Born at Maria-Einsiedeln, in the Canton of Schwyz, Switzerland, Dec. 17 (or 10 Nov.), 1493: died at Salzburg, Sept. 23 (or 24), 1541.  A celebrated German-Swiss physician, reformer of therapeutics, iatrochemist, and alchemist.  He attended school in a small lead-mining district where his father, William Bombast von Hohenheim, was a physician and teacher of alchemy.  The family originally came from Würtemberg, where the noble family of Bombastus was in possession of the ancestral castle of Hohenheim near Stuttgart until 1409.  He entered the University of Basel at the age of sixteen, where he adopted the name Paracelsus, after Celsius, a noted Roman physician.  But he left without a degree, first going to Wurtzburg to study under Joannes Trithemius, Abbot of Sponheim (1462-1516), a famous astrologer and alchemist, who initiated him into the mysteries of alchemy.  He then spent many years in travel and intercourse with distinguished scholars, studied and practiced medicine and surgery, and at one point attended the Diet of Worms.  He was appointed to the office of city physician of Basel, which also made him a lecturer on medicine at Basel about 1526, where, through the publisher Johan Frobenius he made friends with the scholar Erasmus; and there he fulminated against the medical pseudo-science of his day, and against the blind adherence to ancient medical authorities such as Hippocrates\n         Galen, and Avicenna, which was still the prevalent philosophy of medicine in the sixteenth century.  But soon, in 1528, he was driven from the city by the medical corporations, whose methods he had severely criticized.  He found refuge with friends, and traveled and practiced medicine, but could not find a publisher willing to print his books.  He preached frequently the need for experimentation in medicine.  He is important in the history of medicine chiefly on account of the impetus which he gave to the development of pharmaceutical chemistry.  He was also the author of a visionary and theosophic system of philosophy.  The first collective edition of his works appeared at Basel in 1589-91.  Among the many legends concerning him is that concerning his long sword, which he obtained while serving as barber-surgeon during the Neapolitan wars.  It was rumored that in the hilt of the sword he kept a familiar or small demon; some thought he carried the elixer of life in the sword.  He is buried in the cemetary of the Hospital of St. Sebastian in Salzburg.  For more detailed information about Paracelsus, there is a special project, the Zurich Paracelsus Project available on the Web.",

They are categorized as one of the classes of beta-lactam antibiotic.  They are produced naturally by some fungi and bacteria, and industrial production processes almost invariably start from some form of the penicillin nucleus produced by fermentation of microorganisms.  The fermentation products are then chemically modified to produce derivatives of enhanced potency, safety, or antibacterial spectrum.  The first penicillin to see extensive use clinically (during World War II) was penicillin G, also called benzypenicillin, and commonly simply “penicillin”.",

Baeyer's theory is that the carbon dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide, which, uniting with the hydrogen of the water in the cell, produces formaldehyde, the latter forming various sugars through polymerization. Vines suggests that the carbohydrates are secretion products of the chloroplasts, derived from decomposition of previously formed proteids. The food substances are usually quickly translocated, those that accumulate being changed to starch, which appears in the cells almost simultaneously with the sugars. The chloroplasts perform photosynthesis only in light and within a certain range of temperature, varying according to climate. This is the only way in which a plant is able to organize carbohydrates. All plants without a chlorophyll apparatus, as the fungi, must be parasitic or saprophytic.",

This theory is now widely accepted, and explains many geological phenomena such as the clustered locations of earthquakes, mountain building, volcanism, and the similarities observed between the geology of continents, such as South America and Africa which are now far apart, but, according to the theory, were once joined together.  The motions of such tectonic plates are very slow, typically only several centimeters per year, but over tens and hundreds of millions of years, cause very large changes in the relative positions of the continents.  The consequence of such movement of plates is called continental drift.",

It emits only alpha rays, and has a half-life of 138 days.  It is thus more unstable than radium, and a milligram of polonium emits as many alpha particles as 5 grams of radium.  Twenty-seven isotopes are known, with atomic masses from 192 to 218. At present a more practical method of preparation than isolation from ores is the preparation by neutron bombardment of bismuth in a nuclear reactor, and it may be obtained commercially by users having an appropriate permit.",

In a strict sense the term post-impressionism is used to denote the effort at self-expression, rather than representation, shown in the work of Cézanne, Matisse, etc.; but it is more broadly used to include cubism, the theory or practice of a movement in both painting and  sculpture which lays stress upon volume as the important attribute of objects and attempts its expression by the use of geometrical figures or solids only; and futurism, a theory or practice which attempts to place the observer within the picture and to represent simultaneously a number of consecutive movements and impressions. In practice these theories and methods of the post-impressionists change with great rapidity and shade into one another, so that a picture may be both cubist and futurist in character. They tend to, and sometimes reach, a condition in which both representation and traditional decoration are entirely abolished and a work of art becomes a purely subjective expression in an arbitrary and personal language.",
